# there is an onnx export issue if we use torch.qint8 dtype
# so use toch.quint8 even for the symmetric case

# if this set, we use custom scale and zero_point computation code

# In addition USE_FULL_RANGE_FOR_SYMMETRIC enables better utilization of range in symmetric mode
# calculate_qparams in the base class does not handle unsigned tensors in symmetric case correctly
# ideally unsigned tensors (such as the output of ReLU) can be quantized with 256 levels (0-255),
# but calculate_qparams in original torch observers uses 127 levels only in symmetric mode:
#     (0to127 out ot -128to127 if qscheme is torch.int8)
#     (128to255 out ot -128to127 if qscheme is torch.uint8)
# however, enabling this flag changes the behaviour in the Power2 observers
# which are used in our qconfig.get_basic_qat_qconfig()
# This has effect only if COMPUTE_ACCURATE_QPARAMS is set.
USE_FULL_RANGE_FOR_SYMMETRIC = False #True
